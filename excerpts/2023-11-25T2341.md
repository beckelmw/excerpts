> As React, Vue, et al continue to evolve, we're seeing more and more metaframeworks pop up. It's almost as though you can't be successful as a framework without having a metaframework. React has Next.js and Remix. Vue has Nuxt.js. Angular has Analog. Svelte has SvelteKit. Solid.js has SolidStart.
> This seems like complete madness to me. We're building abstractions on top of abstractions, further locking users into those ecosystems and making churn more of a problem than ever. â€” https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/thoughts-on-framework-churn/
