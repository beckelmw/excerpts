I've used `dotenv` for years while developing for nodejs. Node > 20.6.0 now has support for `.env` files by default. Just use `node --env-file .env`.

> Even though this implementation is missing some features, it has some benefits over using a third-party package. Node.js loads and parses the .env file as it is starting up, so you can include environment variables that configure Node.js itself, like NODE_OPTIONS. â€” https://philna.sh/blog/2023/09/05/nodejs-supports-dotenv/
