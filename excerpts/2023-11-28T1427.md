> By the way! For putting curly quotes on blockquote, might as well do that in CSS rather than in the content. — https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/27/the-hanging-punctuation-property-in-css/

```css
blockquote {
  &::before {
    content: open-quote;
  }
  &::after {
    content: close-quote;
  }
}
```
