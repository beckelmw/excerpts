Years ago, I was an avid user of [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader). After it shutdown, I never found a new reader and slowly lost track of a large swath of useful content from reliable folks I had curated over the years. As a side project I am starting to think about building my own.

I like using the AWS services above, but this looks interesting as well. Using a [github action on a cron schedule](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed).
