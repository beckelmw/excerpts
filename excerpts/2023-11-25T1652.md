> Switching the entire operating system's color scheme can get annoying real quick, so Chrome DevTools now allows you to emulate the user's preferred color scheme in a way that only affects the currently visible tab. Open the Command Menu, start typing Rendering, run the Show Rendering command, and then change the Emulate CSS media feature prefers-color-scheme option. â€” https://web.dev/articles/prefers-color-scheme#emulating_prefers-color-scheme_in_devtools

I knew this was possible, but the chrome dev tools don't exactly make it easy to find.
