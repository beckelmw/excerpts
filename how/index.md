## Why I made this site

I came across [Jim Neilsen's note site](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/) and thought it was a cool idea. I spend so much of my time reading, learning and collecting information related to my [job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbeckelman) and [interests](https://beckelman.org). I don't do a great job of sharing what I find. Maybe this site will change that?

> What makes those notes useful is 1) the process of internalizing their meaning through collecting, writing, and publishing them, and 2) the ability to reference them in the future. â€“ https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/notes-dot-jim-nielsen-dot-com/

It also seems like a fun side project during the slow Thanksgiving week. Below is how I did it.
