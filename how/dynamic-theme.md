title: Dynamic theme via OKLCH
---

You can change the theme on this site by clicking the eye dropper icon in the navigation menu.

I am using a web component when the browser supports the OKLCH color format to change a CSS custom property representing the hue value. The hue in OKLCH is a value between 0 and 360.

The basic idea can be seen in this demo by using the slider:

<hue-demo></hue-demo>

<script src="/demos/hue-demo.js" type="module"></script>

The actual web component code can be [seen here on github](https://github.com/beckelmw/excerpts/blob/9fe9599cd10b6e91be4b2fd593d166aa40197ca0/src/components/hue-selector.js).

> The `hsl()` color model is not reliable for manipulating and creating color palettes because it can lead to accessibility issues. `oklch()` offers the same intuitive approach as HSL, but provides much more consistency in its output. â€” https://blog.logrocket.com/oklch-css-consistent-accessible-color-palettes/
